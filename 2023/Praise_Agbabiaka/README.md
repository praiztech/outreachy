# Introduction

Hello everyone!
I am Praise Agbabiaka, a web developer from Nigeria, who advocates for and specializes in accessible web development.
I have first-hand experience of the barriers that a lack of accessibility can present for persons with disabilities. So, when I stumbled on a web development course by Mozilla that introduced me to the basics of digital accessibility, I resolved to grow my skill in digital accessibility so I can build websites and web applications that are as accessible as possible.
I adopt the Shift-Left approach to digital accessibility and so believe that accessibility is best incorporated from the start of a web development project.
My first open-source project was contributing descriptions of the flags of the 194 sovereign countries in the REST Countries API so that web developers who consume the API for their web projects can use the descriptions as alt text of the flag images.
I am excited to be one of those contributing to Wagtail project 3 i.e. Wagtail.org Accessibility.
I look forward to learning and collaborating with you all!
